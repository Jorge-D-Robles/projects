# Jorge Robles' Project Repository

Welcome to my project repository! Here, you'll find a collection of extracurricular projects that I've built to solve problems I've encountered throughout my second Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Queens College. As a former public school music teacher in New York City, I've noticed several issues that could be easily automated using code, and I've based some of my projects on these real-world problems alongside new ideas that have arisen.

## Projects

### Schedule Maker (Java and Python versions)

The Schedule Maker is a program designed to solve the unique scheduling problem faced by Jonas E. Salk Middle School's music lesson plan. The school operates on a two-day cycle with 20 total groups and four periods available for lesson periods each day. The students must not miss the same period more than once every four weeks, and if possible, they should shuffle through Monday - Friday rather than always going on the same day of the week.

The Java version of the Schedule Maker incorporates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance modularity, readability, and maintainability and implements a complete Graphical User Interface (GUI). The Python version, on the other hand, is a more straightforward implementation using only functions and command-line inputs.

### Web Automation Project

This script automates the process of checking for available classes in the user's shopping cart on Schedule Builder and registering for them. It uses Selenium WebDriver for browser automation and handles various edge cases and errors. The script assumes that the user has a CF account and knows their login credentials.

## Usage

For the Schedule Builder, you can run the Java or Python version depending on your preference. For the Web Automation Project, you need to add the courses you want to register for to your shopping cart on CUNYFirst's Schedule Builder before running the script. The script will only attempt to register for classes that are in your shopping cart.

## About Me

I am a current career-changing Queens College alumni who has studied and completed a Computer Science Bachelor's degree in December 2023. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree in Music Education in 2019 and worked as a professional public school Music/Band teacher in the New York area before deciding to embark on a new journey as a Software Engineer. 

I'm always looking for employment opportunities where I can apply my coding skills to solve real-world problems post-graduation. If you're interested in my work or would like to discuss potential opportunities for 2024, please feel free to contact me at: [me@jorgerobles.com](mailto:me@jorgerobles.com).
